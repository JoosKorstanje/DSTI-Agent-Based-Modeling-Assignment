# DSTI-Agent-Based-Modeling-Assignment

This model shows how travellers take their busses. This can be used in city planning in order to decide on the number of busstops and/or busses, depending on the number of travellers and with as core question whether or not adding a new line will work better then just adding more busses and/or more busstops
